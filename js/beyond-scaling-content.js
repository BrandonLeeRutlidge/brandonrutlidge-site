  <h1>Beyond Scaling: A Dimensional Roadmap to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</h1>
  <p class="section-subtitle">Published: 20 May 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Scaling large language models has driven remarkable AI progress, yet it struggles to deliver human-like memory, reasoning, or identity. This paper introduces Dimensional Cognition, a framework that redefines intelligence as a product of qualitative advancements in cognitive architecture, not just computational scale. We propose a four dimensional model to guide Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) development: 1D Predictive Streams, processing linear data with limited continuity; 2D Modular Systems, breaking tasks into specialized subtasks but lacking unity; 3D Temporal and Emotional Continuity, adding persistent memory and simulated emotions for adaptive goals; and 4D Reflective Cognition, enabling self-awareness and autonomous evolution. Drawing on cognitive science, this model exposes the limits of current AI and offers testable benchmarks to measure progress. Our findings suggest that AGI requires layered, structural innovations modularity, continuity, and reflection beyond bigger models. This roadmap paves the way for artificial superintelligence, with significant implications for ethical design. By prioritizing cognitive depth, we can build systems that not only mimic human tasks but also adapt and reflect, ensuring responsible development for a transformative future.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) requires more than prediction. This paper argues that intelligence must be dimensional—built not on more data, but on deeper structures of memory, emotion, modular reasoning, and self-awareness. Each layer of cognition adds a new axis of capability.</p>

  <h2>The Four Dimensions of Intelligence</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>1D – Linear Prediction:</strong> Token-by-token prediction, no memory or modularity.</li>
    <li><strong>2D – Modular Task Decomposition:</strong> Interconnected agents perform specialized functions.</li>
    <li><strong>3D – Temporal and Emotional Continuity:</strong> Systems retain memory, mood, and goal states over time.</li>
    <li><strong>4D – Reflective Meta-Cognition:</strong> Self-improving systems capable of evaluating and modifying their own cognitive architecture.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Why Scaling Isn't Enough</h2>
  <p>Modern LLMs are powerful, but rely on statistical prediction without grounded understanding. Dimensional Cognition introduces structure, persistence, and self-reflection—requirements for any system approaching AGI.</p>

  <h2>Implementation Implications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Multi-agent systems with clear task boundaries (2D)</li>
    <li>Persistent memory and emotional state tracking (3D)</li>
    <li>Autonomous loops for planning, self-evaluation, and modification (4D)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>AGI will not emerge by increasing model size alone. It will require a shift in architecture—toward systems that think across dimensions. This roadmap offers one structured path to begin that journey.</p>
